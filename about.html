			<p>Grounded is a smart bin designed to encourage New Zealanders
         to essentially 'reduce, reuse and recycle' by earning points and
         rewards.</p>
<p> It works by users disposing their rubbish into one of the
Grounded bin. Once it's been disposed in the bin, a QR code will
appear on the screen above the rubbish slot. Primarily, the user will
have installed the app and created an account. The user will then
open the camera on the app and scan the QR code.</p>
<p> Depending on the type of weight of the waste, the user will earn points that
they can convert into New Zealand dollars. They can either spend these money
by shopping on the Marketplace section of the app and the website or donate to any
organizations they please.</p>
<p> This system will not only motivate citizens to recycle but it will
also promote environmental awareness in a collaborative way.</p>
